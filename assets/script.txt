It was supposed to be just another night—until the whispers began...
the shadows in the corner of the room stirred, and they were not alone!
she could feel their eyes on her, watching... waiting...
her reflection in the mirror started to distort, like something was reaching from within!
every time she blinked, the darkness seemed closer... more real...
the room felt colder... the walls seemed to close in, suffocating her!
then the whispering voice, soft but clear, called her name...
she turned, but there was no one there—just the empty space behind her...
her heart raced... faster, faster!
the reflection in the glass was moving... without her!
it was her, but not her... a twisted version of herself!
the thing in the mirror smiled at her, mocking her fear...
no matter how fast she ran, it was always just behind her... always just out of reach!
she tried to scream... but her voice was swallowed by the silence of the room!
suddenly, the mirror cracked! And from the other side... a hand reached out!
before she could escape... the hand grabbed her!
The last thing she saw was her own twisted face in the glass...
